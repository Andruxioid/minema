  "description": "This mod allows you to record fluid movies in Minecraft, even if the video recording itself isn't.\nThis is made possible by a temporary modification of the game timer that ensures a constant game time passed between each frame, disabling any synchronization with the actual time.\nIn other words: performance doesn't matter for fluid videos anymore!",
